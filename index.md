### Biography

Since Jan. 2024, I am an Associate Research Scientist (副研究员) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn). From 07/2018 to 08/2022, I worked with Prof. Xiaokang Yang as a postdoc.  From 09/2022 to 12/2023, I worked in the same affiliation as a Research Associate (助理研究员). I received my PhD degree at DSP Laboratory, Electronic Information School at Wuhan University, supervised by Prof. Dexiang Deng. Before that, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the University of Rochester and Wuhan University, respectively. 

Currently, I am interested in developing accurate and robust perceptual quality models for evaluating and enhancing the quality of various visual contents, aligning the value of powerful **silicon-based machines** with **carbon-based life**.
